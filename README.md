## Overview

This repository is an example of setting up the SonarScanner Analysis with GitHub Actions pipeline for a python project.  
We have multiple CI/CD Pipeline examples, one for connecting to SonarQube Server instance and the other to SonarQube Cloud instance.   

**PLEASE READ OUR SONARQUBE DOCUMENTATION FOR WORKING WITH GITHUB ACTION PIPELINES**  
[GitHub - SonarQube Server Integration](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/latest/devops-platform-integration/github-integration/introduction/)  
[GitHub Actions Pipelines - SonarQube Cloud](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/advanced-setup/ci-based-analysis/github-actions-for-sonarcloud/)

## Important Information in Examples
- On triggers are set to only execute on changes to specific branches and a specific directory in the project, this can be modified with whatever trigger you would want to use.
- They have shallow fetch set to 0. this is required for SonarScanner to properly analyze your project.  
- For more information on how to limit your analysis scope and parameters available, please check **SonarScanner Analysis Scope** and **SonarScanner Analysis Parameters** in the Important Links section.
- The action used for SonarScanner Analysis is `sonarqube-scan-action`, which applies for both SonarQube Server and SonarQube Cloud. But they require different parameters. Examples for both are provided.
    - SonarQube Cloud Example: [sonarqube-cloud.yml](.github/workflows/sonarqube-cloud.yml)  
    - SonarQube Server Example: [sonarqube-server.yml](.github/workflows/sonarqube-server.yml) 
- For both `sonar.projectKey` and `sonarprojectName`, we are using the following `$(echo ${{ github.repository }} | cut -d'/' -f1)-gh_$(echo ${{ github.repository }}` as naming convention. This results in `OrgName-gh_RepoName`.
- Please make sure you have set up your `SONAR_TOKEN` and `SONAR_HOST_URL` secrets or variables. In the command used, `SONAR_TOKEN` is set up as a secret and `SONAR_HOST_URL` is set a variable. If set up differently please change the prefix in the respective parameter.

## Example to fail the entire pipeline if Quality Gate fails
In certain situations, you may want to halt/fail the pipeline if the SonarQube Quality Gate fails, preventing subsequent steps from executing.  
This can be achieved by adding `sonar.qualitygate.wait=true` to the `with: args: >` section in the **SonarQube Analysis** task.  

Example:
``` sh
    with:
        args: >
          -Dsonar.verbose=true
          -Dsonar.sources=src/
          -Dsonar.qualitygate.wait=true
```

## PR Decoration Test  (still working on these instructions)
In SonarQube (Server and Cloud), there is functionality to be able to block PR from being merged to SonarQube  
In GitHub Actions, you need to have the following set up in your Project:  
- Setup a Branch Protetction Rule 
- Select a Target branch to apply the rule to

SonarQube Documentation:
[Prevent Pull Request Merge](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/latest/devops-platform-integration/github-integration/setting-up-at-project-level/#prevent-pull-request-merge)  

In SonarQube Server, you need to make sure the DevOps Integration is correctly configured. Go to the Project, in Project Settings > General Settings > DevOps Platform Integration.
In SonarQube Cloud, you need to make sure the DevOps Integration is correctly configured. Go to the Project, in Administration > General Settings > Repository Binding. 

To test this, follow these steps:
1. Create New Branch
2. In new branch, go to file src/s1940.py
3. Add the following code snippet
``` sh
def fun(a):
  i = 10
  return i + a       # Noncompliant
  i += 1             # this is never executed
```
4. Create PR to merge to the target branch you have set the Branch Protection Rule
5. Wait for the SonarQube Scanner analysis to complete
6. It should Fail and have the PR get blocked from merging
